General rules:
 - follow PEP8 coding standards
 - pylint score should be >8
 - should be python 3.8 compatible


1. Write a python program which will take one string input parameter as command line argument. Validate that input string satisfy below checks:
    - one word only
    - letters and numbers only
    - max length 255 chars
   show error message for invalid inputs. Print "PASS" if the input string is palindrome otherwise "FAIL".

2. Write a generic class for file input/output operations. This class should contain methods for file read, file write and file append.
Derive a child class from this class which will take a file name and a string as input parameter. It should write the string to the file using parent class’ methods read/write. Verify the file’s content after each operation. Also handle exceptions in the code.
 
3. Write a program in python to fire following APIs and verify proper status code:
    a. get : http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
        From the response print username and email for all users
    b. post : http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
        Verify the status code is 201 and print the id from the response
    c. delete : http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
        Verify the status code is 200

4. Write a utility to copy specified file from current directory on to the remote machine (linux) over SSH/SCP.
   E.g. remote_copy.py -s my_test_file.txt -d /tmp -h 192.168.90.12 -u tuser -p tpass
     -s: source file
     -d: destination path on remote machine
     -h: remote host
     -u: remote username
     -p: remote password
   It should copy my_test_file.txt located in current directory to /tmp folder in remote machine with ip 192.168.90.12
